I am a Research Fellow at [National Institute of Applied Statistical Research (NIASRA)](https://www.uow.edu.au/niasra/), University of Wollongong, working with [Prof. Noel Cressie](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/noel-cressie), Prof. [Andrew Zammit Mangion](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/andrew-zammit-mangion), and [Prof. Sumeetpal Singh](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/sumeetpal-singh). My research is mainly focused on the Bayesian implementation of next-generation neural networks, including Fourier Neural Operators. I completed my PhD at [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST)](https://cemse.kaust.edu.sa/stat) under the supervision of [Prof. Ying Sun](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/ying-sun).

My research interests encompass the development of advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques. I am particularly focused on applications in predictive modeling and uncertainty quantification, aiming to couple neural networks with traditional statistical methodologies to obtain efficient data driven solutions to real life problems.

Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a strong foundation in both theoretical and applied aspects of statistics and machine learning, and I am passionate about exploring innovative solutions to complex problems in data science.

** ðŸŽ“ Invitation to Attend PhD Defense! ðŸŽ“ **

I am thrilled to extend a cordial invitation to all esteemed members of our network to attend my upcoming Ph.D. defense. After years of dedicated research and scholarly pursuits, I am excited to share the culmination of my work with you.
Join me as I present my dissertation, Deep Neural Networks for Large-scale Complex Spatial and Spatio-temporal Processes. This research endeavor involves remedying the limitations of conventional statistical methods for Spatio-temporal phenomena through the application of deep learning techniques. This defense marks a significant milestone in my academic and professional journey, and your support and presence would mean the world to me.
Date: 29th May 2024
Time: 9:00 AM - 11:30 AM GMT+3

Your attendance and engagement would not only honor my efforts but also contribute to a stimulating academic discourse. I look forward to sharing insights, exchanging ideas, and celebrating this momentous occasion with each of you.
