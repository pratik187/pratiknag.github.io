* ### Short Bio

I am a Research Fellow at the University of Wollongong, focusing on the Bayesian implementation of next-generation neural networks, including Fourier Neural Operators. I work under the guidance of Prof. Noel Cressie, Prof. Andrew Zammit Mangion, and Prof. Sumeetpal Singh. I completed my PhD at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) under the supervision of Prof. Ying Sun. My research aims to advance machine learning techniques and explore innovative applications across various fields.
